#FAQ
**Q:** Are the note titles case-sensitive?<br>
**A:** No, the program recognises the note as long as you type the full title.

**Q:** Can you give notes the same names?<br>
**A:** Yes, but keep in mind the newer notes will be listed after older notes.

**Q:** Bash is giving me the error `Error: Could not find or load main class com.funtech.java.Main` <br>
**A:** Make sure the class files are in the directories: `/com/funtech/java/`
